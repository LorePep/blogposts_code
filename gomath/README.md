# Is GO good at math?

This folder contains the code for a simple Neural Network implemented in GO.
The code includes tests and an example on a toy problem.

The network has no bias terms and uses the sum of the squared errors as loss.

Example of the training loss is shown below:

The code and the toy problem are inspired by [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6)
